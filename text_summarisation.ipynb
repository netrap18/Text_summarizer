       "  'story': '(CNN) -- The mayor of crime-ridden Camden, New Jersey, has announced layoffs of nearly half of the city\\'s police force and close to a third of its fire department.\\n\\nOne hundred sixty-eight police officers and 67 firefighters were laid off Tuesday, as officials struggle to close a $26.5 million budget gap through a series of belt-tightening measures, Mayor Dana Redd told reporters. The layoffs take effect immediately.\\n\\nRedd said she was unable to secure the $8 million in budget concessions that she says she needed to save the jobs of up to 100 police officers and many of the city\\'s firefighters.\\n\\nThe mayor -- who said she will continue negotiations with police and fire unions -- had been asking the workers to pay more for their health care, freeze or reduce their salaries and take furlough days.\\n\\nThe apparent impasse has left administrators of a city with the second-highest crime rate in the nation scrambling to figure out solutions to keep residents safe. Camden is second only to St. Louis, Missouri, in annual rankings of cities based on compilations of FBI crime statistics.\\n\\nSome clerical officers were demoted and reassigned to the streets, the mayor said, pledging that the cuts would not affect public safety.\\n\\n\"We\\'re still going to protect our residents,\" said Robert Corrales, spokesman for Redd. Public safety \"will remain our top concern. We\\'ll shift our resources to be more efficient with what we have.\"\\n\\nBut police and firefighter union officials say the layoffs will most certainly have an impact.\\n\\n\"It\\'s absolutely, physically impossible to cover the same amount of ground in the same amount of time with less people,\" said John Williamson, president of the Fraternal Order of Police union in Camden. \"Response times will be slower.\"\\n\\nOne local business owner, David Brown, said he does not \"understand how you can do more with less.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to be a pessimist, but I can\\'t be optimistic.\"\\n\\nCamden resident and sanitation worker Gloria Valentin said she is now fearful that the city does not have enough police protection to keep people safe.\\n\\n\"Today is a real sad day in the city of Camden,\" she said.\\n\\n'},\n",

Finance ministers from the five countries have been directed to look into the idea of the development bank and report back at the next summit, Singh said.\\n\\nThe leaders also asked the International Monetary Fund to speed up changes in its governance to better represent the developing world as a voting bloc.\\n\\n\"The rapid recovery of the BRICS economies from the financial crisis highlighted their role as growth drivers of the global economy,\" Singh said.\\n\\nTogether, the BRICS nations make up more than 40% of the world population and one-fifth of the global economy.\\n\\nThe group called for peaceful resolutions of the Syria and Iranian crises.\\n\\n\"We agreed that a lasting solution to the problems in Syria and Iran can only be found through dialogue,\" Singh said.\\n\\nBesides the IMF, the leaders also urged reforms of the United Nations and other international bodies for a larger voice for the developing world.\\n\\n\"Institutions of global political and economic governance created more than six decades ago have not kept pace with the changing world. While some progress has been made in international financial institutions, there is lack of movement on the political side,\" Singh said. \"BRICS should speak with one voice on important issues such as the reform of the UN Security Council.\"\\n\\n'}]"

      "Full Text:\n",
      "I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.\n",
